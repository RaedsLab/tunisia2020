The International Conference in support of Tunisia’s economic, social and sustainable development, TUNISIA 2020, brings together international political decision-makers, investors and Tunisia’s economic partners on 29 and 30 November 2016 in Tunis.

This project is an effort to visualize data of Tunisia 2020 projects in a map explorer originally posted [here](http://www.hbyconsultancy.com/blog/overview-on-tunisia-2020-projects.html) along with a bar chat to show investments by sector and activity.
